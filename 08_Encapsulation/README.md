### üß† **What Are Instance Variables?**

**Instance variables** are variables that belong to a specific object created from a class.

* Each object has **its own copy** of these variables.
* They are used to **store the state** of that specific object.
* They are defined using `self`, like: `self.name`, `self.balance`, etc.

Unlike regular variables in functions (which disappear after the function finishes), **instance variables persist** ‚Äî they stay in memory for as long as the object exists and can be accessed and updated by any method within the class.

---
### üîí **Encapsulation with Objects**

Encapsulation means bundling **data (instance variables)** and the **methods** that operate on that data inside a single unit ‚Äî the object.

- Once we have made and tested a function, we no longer have to worry about its implementation
- You only need to know what argument(s) to send into the function and what it returns.

Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only a well-defined interface for interaction. In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation allows:

- Hiding data (instance variables)
- Providing controlled access through methods
### üíæ **Persistence of Instance Variables**

Unlike normal variables in functions (which reset each time the function runs), instance variables:

* **Stay in memory as long as the object exists**
* Can be used and modified across multiple method calls inside the same object

---

### üë®‚Äçüíª **Roles: Inside vs Outside the Class**

#### 1. **Inside the Class (Developer or Designer)**

* You **define** the instance variables and methods.
* You **decide** how methods interact with each other and how the internal data is managed.
* You **design the interface** ‚Äî i.e., what methods the class will expose to the outside.

#### 2. **Outside the Class (Client)**

* The **client** (another part of the program using the class) **doesn‚Äôt care about how things work inside**.
* The client only needs to:

  * Know **what methods** are available
  * Understand **what arguments** to pass
  * Use the **results** returned

---

### üì¶ **Encapsulation in Action**

Encapsulation achieves two major goals:

1. **Hiding Implementation Details**

   * Internal logic, helper methods, and instance variables are not exposed.
   * This protects the integrity of the object and avoids accidental misuse.

2. **Providing a Clean Interface**

   * Only specific methods are made public.
   * These public methods allow interaction with the object in a controlled and predictable way.

---

### üìå Example in Python

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.__balance = balance  # private variable

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            return True
        return False

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance
```

* **Inside** the class: You control how deposits and withdrawals work.
* **Outside (client)**:

```python
acc = BankAccount(100)
acc.deposit(50)
print(acc.get_balance())  # Output: 150
```

Client code can‚Äôt directly access `__balance` ‚Äî they must use the provided methods. That‚Äôs **encapsulation**.

---

### üß† Summary

Encapsulation:

* Keeps internal details private
* Provides a clear interface
* Makes the code easier to maintain, reuse, and secure

It separates **how something works** (implementation) from **how to use it** (interface).


### üß† **Objects Own Their Data**

In **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, each object is responsible for managing **its own data**. That means:

* Every object stores **its own copy** of instance variables.
* No other part of the program should directly interfere with this data.
* This ownership is a foundational principle of **encapsulation** and **data hiding**.

---

### üë• **Example: The `Person` Class**

```python
class Person():
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
```

When you create objects:

```python
oPerson1 = Person('Joe Schmoe', 90000)
oPerson2 = Person('Jane Smith', 99000)
```

* `oPerson1` and `oPerson2` **each have their own** `name` and `salary`.
* These values are stored as **instance variables** inside each object.
* This is an example of how **data belongs to the object that holds it**.

---

### üîí **Encapsulation: Different Interpretations**

Encapsulation means **hiding the internal state** of an object and **controlling access** to it. But how strictly this rule is followed varies by programming language and philosophy:

#### ‚úÖ **Python‚Äôs Loose Encapsulation**

* Python allows direct access to instance variables:

  ```python
  print(oPerson1.salary)
  oPerson2.salary = 120000
  ```
* This is **legal in Python** but considered **poor design practice** in strict OOP.

#### üîí **Strict Encapsulation (Best Practice)**

* You **shouldn't allow direct access** to instance variables.
* Instead, use **getter and setter methods** to control access:

  ```python
  class Person():
      def __init__(self, name, salary):
          self.__name = name
          self.__salary = salary

      def get_salary(self):
          return self.__salary

      def set_salary(self, new_salary):
          if new_salary > 0:
              self.__salary = new_salary
  ```

This approach:

* Keeps data **safe from accidental modification**
* Allows the class to **validate changes** or **enforce rules**
* Makes your class more **flexible and secure**

---

### üö´ **Why Avoid Direct Access?**

Even though you *can* do this in Python:

```python
print(oPerson1.salary)       # Accessing directly
oPerson1.salary = 500000     # Modifying directly
```

You **should avoid it** because:

* It breaks **data integrity** (no checks or validation)
* It creates **tight coupling** between client code and the class internals
* It makes future changes in your class structure **riskier**

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary**

* Each object **owns and manages its own data** through instance variables.
* **Good OOP design** encourages you to **hide instance variables** and **expose only methods** to interact with that data.
* While Python allows **direct access**, following **strict encapsulation** improves code safety, clarity, and maintainability.
* Use **getter and setter methods** to **protect** and **control** how data is accessed or modified.
