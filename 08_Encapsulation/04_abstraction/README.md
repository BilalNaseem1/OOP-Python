Excellent! You’ve just read a thorough explanation of **abstraction** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and now I’ll break it down **in simple terms with examples**—just like you requested earlier with `@property`.

---

## 🧠 What is **Abstraction**?

> **Abstraction** means **hiding the complex details** and **only showing the essentials** to the user.

It's like using your **mobile phone**:

* You press buttons to make a call.
* You **don’t care** how the signal is sent or how the circuits work.

That’s **abstraction**.

## 🛠️ Abstraction in Programming

Imagine you're writing a class called `Car`:

```python
class Car:
    def start(self):
        print("Car is starting...")

    def drive(self):
        print("Car is moving...")

    def stop(self):
        print("Car is stopped.")
```

Now when someone uses this class:

```python
myCar = Car()
myCar.start()
myCar.drive()
myCar.stop()
```

The **user (client code)** just sees easy-to-understand methods.

But **inside**, you might have hundreds of lines doing:

* Check engine oil
* Verify brake pressure
* Start ignition coils
* Etc...

👉 That’s **abstraction** — hiding what’s complex and showing what’s simple.

## 🔄 Abstraction vs. Encapsulation

| Concept           | Meaning                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Hiding **how** something works (data + methods bundled together) |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding **what’s unnecessary**, showing only what’s important     |

You can think of it this way:

* Encapsulation = making the engine inaccessible
* Abstraction = showing a clean "Start" button

## 🧺 Real Example: `Stack` Class

Here's the code you saw:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dataList = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.dataList.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.dataList:
            raise IndexError("Stack is empty")
        return self.dataList.pop()
```

### 🧑‍💻 How a Developer Uses It

```python
s = Stack()
s.push("A")
s.push("B")
print(s.pop())  # Outputs: B
```

Notice:

* The user doesn't know or care that `dataList` is a list.
* They don’t see `append()` or `pop()` being used.
* They just see **push and pop** = abstraction.

---

## 🔍 Why Abstraction Matters

1. **Simplifies the interface**

   * People using your class don’t need to understand its internal code.

2. **Prevents accidental misuse**

   * If a user had access to `dataList`, they could mess it up directly.

3. **Gives freedom to improve your code later**

   * You can switch from a `list` to something faster (e.g., `deque`) and no user would need to change their code.

## 🏗️ Abstraction with Properties

Earlier you learned `@property` is also **abstraction**:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, salary):
        self.__salary = salary

    @property
    def salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    @salary.setter
    def salary(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Salary can't be negative")
        self.__salary = value
```

Now this works:

```python
p = Person(100)
print(p.salary)     # abstraction: looks like a variable
p.salary = 200      # abstraction: looks like assignment
```

But under the hood, Python is calling:

* `salary()` getter
* `salary(value)` setter

And you can:

* Add validation
* Save history
* Log actions
* Send alerts...

...**all hidden from the user**.

## 🧁 In Simple Words

Think of **abstraction** as a **restaurant menu**:

* You see “Pizza” and “Burger”
* You don’t see ingredients, ovens, chef’s steps, or safety checks

> You use something **without needing to understand its internal machinery** — that’s abstraction.

Let me know if you want a visual diagram of abstraction vs encapsulation or if you'd like to implement abstraction using Python's `abc` module (abstract classes).
