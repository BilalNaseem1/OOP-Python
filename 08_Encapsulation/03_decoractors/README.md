A decorator is a function or method that takes another function/method and extends or modifies its behavior.


## üéØ Your Current Code

You defined a `Person` class using **manual getter and setter methods**:

```python
oPerson.getSalary()
oPerson.setSalary(100)
```

But you cannot do this:

```python
print(oPerson.__salary)  # ‚ùå Error: attribute is private
```

That‚Äôs correct because you used `__salary`, which is **name-mangled** in Python for privacy.

---

## üßπ Problems with Manual Getters/Setters

1. Code is **not clean**.
2. You have to remember to call `getName()` and `setSalary(...)`‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt feel natural in Python.
3. It's **extra typing** for something simple.

---

## ‚úÖ Using `@property` Instead

Let‚Äôs rewrite your class using `@property` so you can write clean code like:

```python
print(oPerson.salary)      # Calls getter
oPerson.salary = 100       # Calls setter
```

---

## ‚ú® Updated Version with `@property`

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.__name = name
        self.__salary = salary

    @property
    def salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    @salary.setter
    def salary(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Salary must be non-negative")
        self.__salary = value

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self.__name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        self.__name = value
```

---

## üíª Usage (Cleaner and Pythonic)

```python
oPerson = Person("Bilal", 90)

print(oPerson.salary)      # ‚úÖ Calls salary getter: 90
oPerson.salary = 100       # ‚úÖ Calls salary setter
print(oPerson.salary)      # ‚úÖ Now 100

print(oPerson.name)        # ‚úÖ "Bilal"
oPerson.name = "Hassan"    # ‚úÖ Calls name setter
print(oPerson.name)        # ‚úÖ "Hassan"
```

---

## üîí Bonus: If you want to make `name` **read-only**, just **remove the setter**:

```python
@property
def name(self):
    return self.__name
```

Now:

```python
oPerson.name = "New Name"  # ‚ùå Error: can't set read-only attribute
```

## üîö Summary

| With your old code             | With `@property`                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `oPerson.getSalary()`          | `oPerson.salary`                    |
| `oPerson.setSalary(100)`       | `oPerson.salary = 100`              |
| Manual method calls            | Cleaner attribute-style access      |
| No validation in direct access | Can add validation in setter easily |
| Less Pythonic                  | More Pythonic and readable          |

Let me know if you want a version that logs changes, prevents updates, or stores a history of changes!


That's a smart question‚Äîand you're absolutely right to wonder:

> "If I can access and modify using `.salary` anyway, why even make variables private or use `@property`? It looks the same!"

Let me explain **why you'd still want to use `@property` with private variables**, even though it looks like you're doing the same thing.

---

## üîç 1. With Public Variables, You Have **No Control**

If you do this:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
```

You can easily do:

```python
p = Person("Ali", 100)
p.salary = -500  # ‚ùå You can't stop this!
```

There's **no way to validate** or **protect your data** anymore.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 2. With Private Variables + `@property`, You Get Full Control

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.__salary = salary

    @property
    def salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    @salary.setter
    def salary(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Salary cannot be negative")
        self.__salary = value
```

Now this:

```python
p.salary = -500  # ‚ùå Raises error
```

You **prevent bad values** and still allow clean syntax like:

```python
p.salary = 200
print(p.salary)
```

## üß† So Why Not Just Use Public Variables?

| Feature                  | Public Variables | `@property` with Private |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Easy to read/write       | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| Can validate input       | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| Can make read-only       | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| Can add logic later      | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| Can log changes          | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes                    |
| Good for future-proofing | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes                    |

## üì¶ Real-World Example

Imagine you're building a payroll system:

```python
employee.salary = "twenty thousand"  # üò± crash
```

With `@property`, you can catch this:

```python
@salary.setter
def salary(self, value):
    if not isinstance(value, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Salary must be a number")
```

---

## üîö TL;DR

> Use private variables + `@property` when you want:

* Clean syntax (like public attributes)
* Protection and validation (like setters)
* Flexibility to **change implementation later**

It‚Äôs the **best of both worlds**: clean for the user, controlled under the hood for you.
