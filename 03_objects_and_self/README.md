## Mental Model 1
Each object is a self-contained unit that contains:
- A data type
- Instance variables
- Methods defined


## Mental Model 2 (Deeper intuition)
Every time you instantiate an object, you get back a value from Python. We typically store the returned value in a variable that refers to the object.
